Build a full-featured match-three game.  This 15+ hour marathon in game development demonstrates advanced features, including:

*re-skinning your game using your own Sprites

*checking for the deadlock condition (no more available moves)

*shuffling the Board pieces

*building a one-, two-, or three-star score meter

*creating new level objectives (scored, timed, and collected)
